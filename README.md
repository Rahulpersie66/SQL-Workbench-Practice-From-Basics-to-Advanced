# SQL-Workbench-Practice-From-Basics-to-Advanced
It is a  SQL practice repository covering basics to advanced topics. It includes exercises on SELECT statements, WHERE clauses, GROUP BY, JOINS, window functions (OVER(), PARTITION BY), ROW_NUMBER(), string functions, subqueries, CTEs, temp tables, stored procedures, triggers, and events. Each topic is demonstrated with real-world examples.

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of SQL queries and practices, ranging from basic operations to advanced techniques. The practice sessions are designed to strengthen and demonstrate proficiency in SQL through real-world scenarios and structured exercises.

## Key Topics Covered:

**Basic SQL Queries**: Simple SELECT statements, filtering data with WHERE clauses, and sorting results.
**Aggregate Functions**: Use of SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, and MAX functions to perform calculations on data sets.
GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses: Grouping data for aggregated analysis and filtering grouped data.
**Joins**: Various JOIN operations, including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN to combine data from multiple tables.
**Window Functions**: Advanced analytics with OVER(), PARTITION BY, ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and DENSE_RANK().
**String Functions**: Manipulating text data with CONCAT, SUBSTRING, REPLACE, and other string functions.
**Subqueries**: Nested queries to retrieve data for complex filtering and calculations.
**Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Simplifying complex queries using WITH clauses.
**Temporary Tables**: Creating and managing temporary tables for intermediate data storage.
**Stored Procedures**: Encapsulating SQL logic in reusable procedures.
**Triggers**: Automating actions in response to specific changes in data.
**Events**: Scheduling and automating SQL tasks using events.
This project serves as a hands-on learning experience, with practical examples and exercises designed to deepen understanding of SQL concepts. Each file in the repository is organized by topic, with clear examples and explanations of the queries used.
